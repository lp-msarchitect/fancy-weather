 SPA weather forecast
 
 [Demo](https://lp-msarchitect-fancy-weather.netlify.app/)
 
 You can see the detailed weather for today and the forecast for three days.
 The application also shows the coordinates and location on the map
 
 In this project I mastered:
 - using geocoder
 - yandex map
 - using several api and combining results
 - Babel
 - Geolocation
 
 All components using in the app are in the `src/components` folder. Styles are in the `src/styles` folder.
 
 You can run this project locally just do:
 - clone this repo with `git clone https://github.com/lp-msarchitect/fancy-weather.git` or fork it and then clone it from your forked repo
 - `cd movie-search`
 - `npm install` 
 - `npm start`
